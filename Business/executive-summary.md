# FreshWall Business Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

**FreshWall** is a mobile-first SaaS platform for graffiti removal companies and urban beautification crews. Purpose-built for field use, it enables teams to log graffiti removal jobs with before/after photos, track cleanup progress, and compile monthly reports for clients, municipalities, or grant funders. 

The app is optimized for speed, accountability, and reporting — empowering small businesses to prove their impact and get paid. The initial release targets iOS, with a future web dashboard planned for generating reports and managing data.
